Smart Grain Guardian â€“ Real-Time Grain Monitoring System
The Smart Grain Guardian is a cost-effective, scalable food storage monitoring system that uses environmental sensors, IoT connectivity, and GSM alerts to prevent grain spoilage. This project aims to revolutionize grain preservation practices by offering real-time insights, automated alerts, and remote access to critical data.

Project Overview
Designed to monitor grain storage facilities, this system continuously tracks temperature, humidity, gas emissions, and light exposure. When thresholds are breached, it sends SMS notifications to stakeholders and stores sensor data for later analysis via IoT platforms.
- Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions
